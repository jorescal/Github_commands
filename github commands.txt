*** SSH Key Generation


Step 1: Download Git Bash.

https://git-scm.com/downloads


Step 2: Type the following, replacing with the email address that is linked to your Github account, and hit Enter:


ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<your email address>"

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jorescal@gmail.com"



This will generate a new SSH key.




Step 3: Next, you will be prompted to enter a directory to save the key. I simply press Enter to accept the default location, which is a .ssh folder in the home directory. In other words, you will be able to locate the key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa (in my case '/c/Users/user1/.ssh').



Step 4: You will then be prompted to choose a passphrase. I prefer not to have a passphrase, so just press Enter and Enter again to confirm the empty passphrase.

Now, if you navigate to the .ssh directory, i.e., if you run the following in the Git Bash terminal,

cd ~/.ssh

and then,

ls

To list the contents of the .ssh directory, you should find id_rsa and id_rsa.pub in the list of contents, where id_rsa is the private version of your key and id_rsa.pub is the public version of your key.



Step 5: Finally, you will need to add the SSH key to the ssh-agent, which is meant to help with the authentication process. To do that, first you need to start the ssh-agent, so run the following in the Git Bash terminal:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

Step 6: And then add the key to the agent by running the following in the Git Bash terminal:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa



		--Steps to Add SSH Key :

https://github.com/IBM/skillsnetwork/blob/master/tools/GITHUB%20-%20Part%201.pdf



Open GitBash to copy the SSH key previously generated.

Step 1: Copy the command using the below command:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip

NOTE: If clip doesn't work, use cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub on command line and the copy the output.

Step 2: Now, Open GitHub and go to Setting (Click on the arrow)

Step 3: Under Personal settings, select SSH and GPG keys, as shown below:

Step 4: Click the button to add a New SSH key.

Step 5: Provide the title. Then select the Key field, and press Ctrl-v to paste the key from the clipboard buffer. The pasted key should have your email address at the end, as shown below:

and click Add SSH Key.

Now, the SSH key is added to your account.



*** First thing after setting up github integration 

Step 1 
go to Github account and create a new repository


cd ~/Desktop/

mkdir Github
cd Github

mkdir GitReps
cd GitReps

mkdir github_commands
cd github_commands
git config --global user.email "jorescal@gmail.com"
git clone git@github.com:jorescal/Github_commands.git
ls
mkdir github_commands.txt
ls -l -a
echo "# github_commands.txt...  " >> github_commands.txt

git add 'github commands.txt'
git status
git commit  -m "UPDATING github_commands.txt"
git push








*** Pull repository from github, update the repository with new files and push the repository for a "Pull request".


cd downloads 
mkdir demo
cd demo
git clone git@github.com:jorescal/test.git
mkdir test.txt
ls -l -a

vi test.txt
	"Hellow World"

# or 

echo "# test11" >> test.txt
ls

git add test.txt
git status
git config --global user.email "jorescal@gmail.com"
git commit  -m "initial commit"
git push



*** create repository on local computer and push it to github


cd downloads 
mkdir demo
cd demo

echo "# test11" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/jorescal/test2.git
git push -u origin master
                


*** Create a new branch

git branch mybranch
git status
git checkout mybranch
git status
ls
echo "# branch" >> stuffonmybranch.txt
git add stuffonmybranch.txt
git commit -m "bla bla bla"
git push --set-upstream origin mybranch    #this command is to create the branch remotly
git push
git checkout master 
git merge mybranch
git push
